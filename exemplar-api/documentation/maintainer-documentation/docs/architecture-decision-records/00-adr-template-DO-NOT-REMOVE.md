This is a template page to be duplicated by any ADRs created through the duration of the project

# Title
###### [AUTHOR_NAME], [ROLE], [DATE]
###### [CONTACT_INFORMATION]

The Title should be a description of the decision, rather than the problem.

For example:

- Use of MkDocs for documentation sites
- Use of neoteroi.mkdocsoad Plugin

This section should be removed from ADRs.

## Status

Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded by ADR-zzz

## Context
