  ## Service Level Agreements

  This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

  For more details, see service levels.

  ## Rate Limiting

  This API is rate-limited to 1 requests per minute. If the limit is exceeded, a
  `429 Too Many Requests` response is returned with a `Retry-After` header.

  ## Technology

  This API is RESTful.
  </br></br>

  It conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to FHIR R4 (v4.0.1), except that it does not support the capabilities interaction.
  </br></br>

  It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against FHIR UK Core, specifically UK.core.r4 1.0.0.
  </br></br>

  You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

  <li>resource names are capitalised and singular, for example /Patient not /patients</li>
  <li>array names are singular, for example line not lines for address lines</li>
  <li>data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an extension object</li>

  
  ## Network access
  
  This section should include information about how the API is exposed and if it is visible over the internet, or requires access to internal network.

  ## Environments and testing

  | Environment | Base URL |
  |-------------|----------|
  | Sandbox | https://sandbox.api.example.com/FHIR/R4/ |
  | UAT | https://uat.api.example.com/FHIR/R4/ |
  | Production | https://api.example.com/FHIR/R4/ |


  ### Sandbox testing
  
  Our sandbox environment:

  <li>is for early developer testing</li>
  <li>only covers a limited set of scenarios</li>
  <li>is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates</li>
  <li>is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation</li>


  ### UAT

  Our UAT environment:

  <li>is for formal integration testing</li>
  <li>is stateful, so persists updates</li>
  <li>includes authorisation</li>

  To test updating patient details, you must set up your own test data.
  </br>

  ### Production smoke testing
  
  You must not use real patient data for smoke testing in the production environment.
  </br></br>

  Rather, use our production test patient.
